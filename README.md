# Mia-Ajuda

Welcome to Mia-Ajuda, this is a project whose objective is to unite people who need help with people who can help.

It is a project created and developed by professors and students from Faculdade do Gama (FGA), Universidade de Brasília, with the aim of contributing to society in a time of need that we are experiencing in relation to CoVid-19. The application is intended to be a tool to encourage social actions of help and collaboration between people from communities and neighborhoods.
Mia Ajuda serves as a means of connecting people in need and volunteers who can help, whether in an immaterial way (entertainment, company, psychological support), or in a material way (food, objects, personal hygiene items).

We are an Open Source project made by students from Universidade de Brasília and the technologies we use are based on MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React-Native and NodeJS) technologies.

If you are interested in contributing, please access our documentation:

And it's possible to contribute with documentation as well, cloning this repository and changing the files inside folder 'docs'.

To run this documentation project you need to have a Docsify CLI installed:
